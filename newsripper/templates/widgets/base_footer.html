          News stories ripped straight from the headlines (and their respective news sites).

          Content is scraped using
          <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup4</a>,
          a Python package that can parse HTML documents. These documents are obtained via simple GET request.

          Though a target site may use JavaScript to hide content after it has been loaded,
          we only deal with that original document. So, until they decide not to produce
          an article <em>at all</em> except to logged-in users, this scaper is totally legit.
