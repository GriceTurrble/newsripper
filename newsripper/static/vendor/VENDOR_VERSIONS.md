# Vendor Static library versions

| Library | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Bootstrap | 4.4.0 |
| FontAwesome | 5.11.2 - free version<sup>1</sup> |
| jQuery | 3.4.1 |

## Notes

1. FontAwesome 5 has a paid "pro" tier that I am not using. Some parts of the library will be unavailable, marked in the FA docs as "Pro license required" ([example: fa-abacus](https://fontawesome.com/icons/abacus?style=solid)).
    * To see free-only icons, check the gallery with the "Free" filter turned on ([link](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free)).
